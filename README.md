# Airplane Records Management System

Welcome to the Airplane Records Management System (ARMS) project! This project aims to develop a REST API for airlines to efficiently manage and record information related to their airplanes, trips, passengers, and crew. Additionally, the system provides tools for analyzing flight data, including punctuality metrics and plane occupancy.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Entity Framework Core

## Features

- **RESTful API**: The core of ARMS is a REST API that allows airlines to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on airplane records, trips, passengers, and crew members.

- **Data Management**: ARMS provides a centralized platform for storing and managing all relevant information about airplanes, trips, passengers, and crew members. This includes details such as flight schedules, passenger manifests, crew assignments, and more.

- **Flight Analysis**: The system offers tools for analyzing flight data, including punctuality metrics such as on-time performance, flight delays, and cancellations. Additionally, ARMS can generate reports on plane occupancy, passenger demographics, and other relevant metrics.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: To ensure data security, ARMS supports authentication and authorization mechanisms. Airlines can control access to sensitive information by assigning roles and permissions to users.

- **Scalability and Performance**: ARMS is designed to be scalable and capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently. The system is optimized for performance to provide a seamless user experience even during peak usage times.
